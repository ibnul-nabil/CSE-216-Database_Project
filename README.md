📚 Boi Somahar

A Rokomari-style book marketplace — with a twist

Boi Somahar is a full-stack online book-selling platform built as part of our Database course project.
The central objective of the system is to implement advanced database techniques — including complex SQL queries, relational design, and PL/SQL procedures — while building a real, functional web application.

Unlike traditional book-selling platforms, Boi Somahar does not maintain its own warehouse.
Instead, publishers list their own books, and orders are forwarded directly to publishers, who then deliver the books to customers. This eliminates the need for storage and handling by the platform.
